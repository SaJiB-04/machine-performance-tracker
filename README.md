# Machine Performance Tracker üõ†

This is a Python mini-project that collects and analyzes weekly performance data for multiple machines. It calculates total operation hours, downtime, defects, and efficiency, then generates a report.

## Features
- User input for 7 days of data per machine
- Calculates:
  - Total operation hours
  - Total downtime hours
  - Total defects
  - Efficiency (%)
- Saves a report as a `.txt` file

## Future Plans
- Add data visualization (using matplotlib)
- Support importing data from CSV files

## How to Run
1. Open `performance_tracker.py` in a Python environment
2. Follow prompts to enter data
3. Check `performance_report.txt` for the summary
